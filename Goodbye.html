        <h2>Goodbye</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hello,
            <br>
            <br>

            If you’re reading this I am dead or almost there.
            <br>
            If you’re not mentioned its because you didn’t know me well, at least in the end.
            <br>

            Please make sure my mum and dad are okay. <br>
            I want mum to move on, achieve her dreams and be happy. <br>
             Dad’s already lost two kids and I need you all to make sure he’s okay.
             <br>
             <br>

            You may be wondering why I chose to end my life. <br>
            I no longer wish to live for other people. <br>
            I lived with depression for around ten years, suicidal thoughts for 6 - almost 7. <br>
            The only thing I wanted, truly, was for things to get better but they never did. <br>
             I didn’t want to end it for so long, just because I didn’t want you all to suffer. <br>
            I can’t go on anymore. <br>
            <br>

            I started running when I was 15, got good at it, then injured my legs. <br>
            My brain could do the academic stuff well, at least until COVID, now thoughts and words are just jumbled. <br>
            I lost my confidence and drive, because every part of me seemed broken or incomplete. <br>
            <br>

            I never kept friends long, they just seemed to forget about or ignore me in the end. <br>
            I think I became easier to be around as I grew up. <br>
            This didn’t matter much as things just turned out the same way. <br>
            I’ve always felt a sense of loneliness, that couldn’t be quelled no matter what I tried. <br>
            The feelings of otherness and a sense of disquiet seemed to grow worse over time. <br>
            I did’t think I would ever have somebody who stays or I enjoy being around enough to make forget how I felt.<br>
            <br>

            I wasn’t a part of my family, at least not really. I always felt like I was the last to be remembered, last to know. <br>
            One of the toughest feeling is feeling like an outsider around your flesh and blood. <br>
            It just felt there was a gap between me and them, that would never close. <br>
            Deep down, I didn’t hate any of you, I just wish things could’ve been better. <br>

            Feel free to keep any of my clothes, books or films. <br>
            Sell the music stuff though, it’s pretty valuable. <br>
            Use the money to cremate me and use whatever’s left over on something nice. <br>
            I didn’t die with any debts, so there’s nothing to worry about there. <br>
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>Goodbye, Romario</p>
